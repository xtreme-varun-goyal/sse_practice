To ensure traffic destined for mobile users\nin a specific region (e.g., North America) traverses the service connection in that same region, you\nneed to control the route advertisements.\nFiltering out the mobile user pool prefixes from the other region on each service connection achieves\nthis by:\nPreventing the data center in one region from learning the specific mobile user prefixes of the other\nregion. For example, the North American service connection would filter out the mobile user pool\nprefixes  allocated  to European  users.\nEnsuring that when a data center needs to send traffic to a mobile user, it will only see and use the\nroute advertised by the service connection in the appropriate geographical region. This forces the\ntraffic to enter the Prisma Access infrastructure through the intended regional service connection.\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect based on official documentation regarding default\nrouting mode:\nA . Configure BGP on the customer premises equipment (CPE) to prefer the assigned community\nstring attribute on the mobile user prefixes in its respective Prisma Access region. While BGP\ncommunities can be used for influencing routing decisions, in the context of default routing mode\nand ensuring regional traffic flow, relying solely on the CPE to prefer community strings might not be\nthe most robust or direct method to guarantee traffic traverses the correct regional service\nconnection. The service connection itself needs to control the advertisement of prefixes.\nC . Configure BGP on the customer premises equipment (CPE) to prefer the MED attribute on the\nmobile user prefixes in its respective Prisma Access region. The BGP MED (Multi -Exit Discriminator)\nattribute is primarily used to influence the path selection between autonomous systems (AS) or\nwithin the same AS at different entry points. In this scenario, where service connections are\nadvertising prefixes, filtering at the source (service connection) is a more direct and reliable way to\nensure  regional  traffic  flow than  relying  on the MED  attribute  on the CPE.\nD . Configure each service connection to prepend the BGP ASN five times for mobile user pool\nprefixes originating from the other region. BGP AS path prepending is a mechanism to make a path\nless desirable. While this could influence routing, it doesn't guarantee that traffic will always take the\n\n=== PAGE 9 ===\nintended regional path. Filtering provides a more definitive control over which routes are advertised\nand learned.\nTherefore, configuring each service connection to filter out the mobile user pool prefixes from the\nother region in the advertisements to the data center is the verified method to ensure traffic\ndestined for mobile users traverses the service connection in the appropriate region when using\nPrisma  Access  in default  routing  mode."

Service connection licenses will be assigned only to the first tenant, and these service connections\ncan be shared with the other tenants. This statement is incorrect. In a multitenant Prisma Access\ndeployment, licenses are typically managed and allocated per tenant. While the underlying\ninfrastructure might be shared by Palo Alto Networks, the logical resources and often the licensing\n\n=== PAGE 19 ===\nare segmented for each tenant. Sharing service connections across completely separate tenants\nwould  violate  the principle  of tenant  isolation.\n\nB . A single tenant cannot consist solely of mobile users or solely of remote networks. This statement\nis incorrect. Prisma Access multitenancy allows for flexibility in how tenants are configured. A tenant\ncan be designed to exclusively serve mobile users, exclusively connect remote networks, or a\ncombination of both, depending on the organizational structure and requirements.\n\nD . There is flexibility to manage different tenants using separate Panoramas, which allows for better\norganization and management of the multiple tenants.  While it is possible to have multiple\nPanorama instances managing different parts of a large infrastructure, when discussing multitenancy\nwithin a single Prisma Access instance (as implied by the question \"enabling multitenancy in Prisma\nAccess (Managed by Panorama))\", all configured tenants are managed by that single Panorama\ninstance. Managing different tenants with separate Panoramas is a different architectural\nconsideration, not a defining characteristic of enabling multitenancy within one Prisma Access\ndeployment  managed by a specific  Panorama.\n\nTherefore, the defining characteristic of Prisma Access multitenancy (Managed by Panorama) is the\nallocation of dedicated Prisma Access instances and compute resources for each tenant, ensuring\nlogical  separation  and resource  isolation"

Apply File Blocking to stop file uploads containing financial information. While File Blocking can\nprevent the upload of certain file types, it is not content -aware.

By manipulating these risk scores, you can influence how these\napplications are treated within Security policies.\n\n=== PAGE 30 ===\nTo limit the use of unsanctioned  SaaS applications:\nLower the risk score of sanctioned applications: This makes them less likely to trigger policies\ndesigned  to restrict  high-risk activities.\nIncrease the risk score of unsanctioned applications: This elevates their perceived risk, making them\nmore likely to be caught by Security policies configured to block or limit access based on risk score\nthresholds.\nThen, you would create Security policies that take action (e.g., block access, restrict features) based\non these adjusted risk scores. For example, a policy could be configured to block access to any SaaS\napplication with a risk score above a certain threshold, which would primarily target the\nunsanctioned applications with their inflated scores.\nLet's analyze  why the other  options  are incorrect  based  on official  documentation:\nB . Increase the risk score for all SaaS applications to automatically block unwanted applications.\nIncreasing the risk score for all SaaS applications, including sanctioned ones, would lead to\nunintended blocking and disruption of legitimate business activities. Risk score customization is\nintended for differentiation,  not a blanket  increase.\nC . Build an application filter using unsanctioned SaaS as the category. While creating an application\nfilter based on the \"unsanctioned SaaS\" category is a valid way to identify these applications, it\ndirectly filters based on the category itself, not the risk score. Risk score customization provides a\nmore nuanced approach where you can define thresholds and potentially allow some low -risk\nactivities within unsanctioned applications while blocking higher -risk ones.\nD . Build an application filter using unsanctioned SaaS as the characteristic. Similar to option C, using\n\"unsanctioned SaaS\" as a characteristic in an application filter allows you to directly target these\napplications. However, it doesn't leverage the risk score customization feature to control access\nbased  on a graduated  level  of risk.\nTherefore, the most effective way to use risk score customization to limit unsanctioned SaaS\napplication usage is by lowering the risk scores of sanctioned applications and increasing the risk\nscores of unsanctioned ones, and then building Security policies that act upon these adjusted risk\nscores.\n\n=== PAGE 31 ===\nThank  You  for Being Our Valued Customer\n                        We Hope You Enjoy Your Purchase\n                          Palo Alto Networks SSE -Engineer Exam\n                                          Question & Answers\n           Palo Alto Networks Security Service Edge Engineer Exam"
