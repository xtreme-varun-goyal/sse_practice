    "question": "A customer requires that sensitive uploads be blocked everywhere, but executives can still access risky sites in isolation. They also want centralized visibility for auditors. Which solution set best satisfies all requirements? The intent is to allow access while reducing endpoint risk exposure. Users report behavior that suggests either the wrong rule is matching or the wrong action is being taken. Pick the option that best explains the behavior without resorting to global disablement.",

      "DLP with scoped actions + RBI for risky categories with exec exceptions + centralized logging + RBAC separation",

    "explanation": "This combines data protection (DLP), web isolation where needed (RBI), exceptions by identity, centralized evidence (logs), and governance (RBAC).",
